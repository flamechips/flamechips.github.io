<h3>Welcome!</h3>

<p>Hello! I'm Paul, also known as <a href="https://twitter.com/lamechips">@lamechips</a>. I like to make games, art, and music. I've always enjoyed creating, so it seems it's a good idea now for me to have a site to share what I've made and learned!</p>

<p>At the moment, this is really just a code blog (you can find those posts <a href="/blog/">here</a> or by clicking the <em>BLOG</em> tab up above). These days I mostly work with 3D stuff and shaders in <code>GameMaker Studio</code> + <code>GLSL</code>, so you can expect most of what I write here will be about that.</p>

<p>I may eventually add a gallery to this site, but I would primarily recommend finding me on <a href="https://twitter.com/lamechips">Twitter</a>, since that's where I tend to post my little gifs and WIPs and will continue to do so. If you just wanna chat, Twitter would also be the place to do that, though I get a bit nervous talking to people sometimes so please don't be offended if my response is not immediate.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
